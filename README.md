Gio - Snake - Game -- 
The Snake no one Wants, but Everyone deserves
=================


In order to use the Snapchat login and bitmoji functionality on index.html, your Snap username will need to be added 
to the project on SnapKit. 

In order to play the game: you are a snake that you can control with your arrow keys, or using the WASD keys. 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as you can without accidentally eating yourself.
A scoreboard keeps track of the user's score and speed will increase incrimentally as the game progresses.
After loosing, click anywhere on the death screen to try again, and get a higher score!

Theres a green powerup that makes you invincible for 5 seconds! The player's head will get bigger momentarily, but don't get caught when the timer runs out!

Project Outline
------------

### ← README.md -- THIS IS NOT UPDATED, COPIED FROM ANOTHER PROJECT

That's this file, which you are currently reading :)

### ← index.html and index-login.js 

These two files are responsible for the home page of the game, including the log in via Snapchat's Login Kit.
If you are not added onto my login kitm 

### ← game.html, game.css, and game.js

These are responsible for running the snake squad game. game.html relies on game.css for styling and game.js for interactivity. 
The entirety of the game runs in game.js, with very minimal styling applied to the actual game screen.
Most of the CSS in this project is for styling the initialization page.
