/////NOT UPDATED -- COPIED FROM ANOTHER PROJECT..
In order to use the Snapchat login and bitmoji functionality on index.html, your Snap username will need to be added 
to the project on SnapKit. 

In order to play the game: you are a snake that you can control with your arrow keys, or using the WASD keys. 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as you can without accidentally eating yourself.
A scoreboard keeps track of the user's score and speed will increase incrimentally as the game progresses.
After loosing, click anywhere on the death screen to try again, and get a higher score!

Theres a green powerup that makes you invincible for 5 seconds! The player's head will get bigger momentarily, but don't get caught when the timer runs out!

Project Outline
------------

### ← README.md 

That's this file, which you are currently reading :)

### ← index.html 

This is the main file that hosts all of the main elements. It gets manipulated by adding the messages onto it during runtime.

### ← main.css

This file handles most of the CSS in the application, since most of the elements come from Google's MDL Framework

### ← main.js

This code handles the bulk of the work, interfacing with a firebase backend to deploy the website on a firebase server (link below)

## Assets
All Colors are imported from the Google Material Design Lite Stylesheets
